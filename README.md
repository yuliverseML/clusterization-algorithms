This project implements customer segmentation using machine learning techniques, specifically Agglomerative Clustering and K-Means.It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, cluster optimization, and visualization of results.


 The primary goal is to divide customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, which can be utilized for targeted marketing, customer retention strategies, and personalized service offerings.
